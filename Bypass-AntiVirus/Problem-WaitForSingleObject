The shellcode of msfvenom used the WaitForSingleObject function and 
the default values prevent the application to execute until the shell is released.\

To solve this change the „DEC ESI“ code at the end of the shellcode with a nop.

If we look closely, we’ll see that it uses the WaitForSingleObject function.

WaitForSingleObject function waits until the specified object is in the signaled state or the time-out interval elapses.


So after our shellcode spawns a shell with CreateProcessA, it performs a call to WaitForSingleObject before 
continuing to block_exitfunk.asm.
In this call, it pushes the timeout first(-1 : INFINITE) and then the object handle 
(right to left convention), INFINITE is not the right parameter to push in our case; 
The program will get stuck until we exit the process created manually. 
The solution is simply to change the dec esi instruction to nop
